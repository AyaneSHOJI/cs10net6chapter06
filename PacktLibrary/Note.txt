- Managing memory

2 categories of memory : stack and heap
stack : faster to work with, but limited in size
heap : slower but much more pleintiful

object types : class, record and struct => difference is how memory is allocated
record or class are reference type, only the memory address of the object on the heap

record struct or struct are value type, object allocated on the stack

struct types: Number System.Types, other system types, system.Drawing types

total bytes used by all the field in type is 16 bytes or less, use struct

- Convert vs. Cast
Convert : between dismmilar types e.g. text / number
Cast : between similar types e.g. 16-bit integer / 32-bit integer, superclass / its subclass
